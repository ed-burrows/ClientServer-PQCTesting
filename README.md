# ClientServer-PQCTesting
A simple client-server application, secured with TLS, used as part of my dissertation at the University of Suffolk to test the efficiency and usability of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms in a real-world scenario.
## Overview
This project forms part of my dissertation whilst studying at the University of Suffolk. It aims to test the efficiency of post-quantum digital signature algorithms against traditional algorithms in a real-world scenario. In this instance, ML-DSA was chosen as the PQC algorithm to provide digital signatures, and RSA as the traditional algirithm.
### Rationale
The issue of PQC adoption has interested me throughout my studies at university. Whilst I was conducting a review of recent literature, it struck me how little literature existed that explicitly covered how effective, and more importantly how efficient, PQC algorithms were in a real-world scenario, but also using 'modern' technology (i.e. on a traditional computer).
