# ClientServer-PQCTesting
A simple client-server application, secured with TLS, used as part of my dissertation at the University of Suffolk to test the efficiency and usability of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms in a real-world scenario.
## Overview
This project forms part of my dissertation whilst studying at the University of Suffolk. It aims to test the efficiency of post-quantum digital signature algorithms against traditional algorithms in a real-world scenario. In this instance, ML-DSA was chosen as the PQC algorithm to provide digital signatures, and RSA as the traditional algorithm.

The project consists of a simple client-server application, implemented in Java, that provides the transfer of files from the client to the server. The client (ClientApp) generates a digital signature based on a given file (using either RSA or ML-DSA), before connecting to the server (ServerApp), whereby the file, signature, and public key and transferred. This is then verified by the server to validate that the files were sent by, and were also generated by, the client they were connected to.

The BenchmarkLogger class is used throughout the life of the application to capture various metrics, including key sizes, digital signature file sizes, as well as the time taken to execute various parts of the applications core functionality.
## Rationale
The issue of PQC adoption has interested me throughout my studies at university. Whilst I was conducting a review of recent literature, it struck me how little literature existed that explicitly covered how effective, and more importantly how efficient, PQC algorithms were in a real-world scenario, but also using 'modern' technology (i.e. on a traditional computer).
